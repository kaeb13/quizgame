### Score Page (Fictive)

Please note that the current score page is fictive and does not display actual user scores. However, in the long run, this page could be developed further to record and display real user scores, offering a more engaging and competitive experience for players.

The score page is generated using JavaScript. It creates a list of random user names and scores for demonstration purposes.
